 * @brief A contiguous span of a @ref memory_heap tracked by a caching pool.
 *
 * Blocks are linked into two containers of the pool at once, hence the two
 * hooks: one list of every block of every heap in address order, which is what
 * makes coalescing a neighbour lookup, and one set of the free ones only, which
 * is what makes finding a candidate a lower bound.
 *
 * A block belongs to the timeline of the queue it was last handed out to. Work
 * submitted to that queue runs in order, so a block that came back from it can
 * be handed out to it again without synchronizing at all. Reaching it from any
 * other queue is what costs.
