/**
 * @brief Hands out blocks of memory, keeping what it takes from the driver.
 *
 * Reaching the driver for every allocation is far too slow to do per
 * operation, so memory taken from it is kept and handed out again. What makes
 * that safe is knowing, for each block, what has to have finished before it
 * can be handed out once more.
 *
 * Blocks belong to the queue they were last handed to. That queue runs its
 * work in order, so giving one of its own blocks straight back to it costs
 * nothing. Taking one over from another queue costs a wait, which is scheduled
 * on the device rather than on the calling thread. Only when neither is
 * possible does the pool grow, doubling each time so that a workload settles
 * into asking the driver for nothing at all.
 *
 * A block whose owner is dropped while some other queue may still be using it
 * does not hold up that drop: it is held back until those queues have caught
 * up.
 *
 * Deals in blocks rather than in buffers, and knows nothing of the resource
 * they are said to come from. Turning one into the other is
 * @ref caching_memory_allocator's job.
 *
 * Thread safe.
