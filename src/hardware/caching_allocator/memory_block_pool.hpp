/**
 * @brief The cache of a caching allocator: heaps, and the blocks they are cut
 * into.
 *
 * Free blocks are kept sorted by the queue they belong to first and by their
 * size second, which makes finding the best fit for a queue a lower bound.
 * Every block, free or not, is also kept in address order, which makes
 * coalescing a look at the neighbours.
 *
 * Blocks belonging to no queue are the cheapest to hand out, since nothing can
 * still be running against them. A heap starts out that way and only becomes
 * bound to a queue once it has been handed to one.
 *
 * The pool never talks to a device. Whatever the caller has to wait for before
 * taking a block over from another queue is the caller's to arrange.
