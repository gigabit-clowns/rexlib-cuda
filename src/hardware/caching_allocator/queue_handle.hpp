/**
 * @brief The parts of a @ref command_queue that a memory pool needs.
 *
 * A pool outlives the queues that allocated from it, so it stores this by value
 * rather than keeping a pointer to a queue that may already be gone. The
 * ordinal travels along because an event can only be recorded on a stream of
 * the device it was created on, and there is no way to ask a stream which
 * device that is.
 *
 * A stream handle can be reused by the driver once its stream is destroyed, so
 * two queues may compare equal here at different points in time. That is
 * harmless: destroying a stream waits for the work submitted to it, so anything
 * this handle was used to order against has already completed by then.
